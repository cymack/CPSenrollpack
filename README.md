This repository contains enrollment data that were extracted from Chicago Public Schools (CPS) public records. The prepared data are available at this repository in Rds and csv formats; at present there are only high school data, with elementary school data forthcoming. The sets span the school years from 2006--2007 through 2018--2019, and will be periodically updated.
